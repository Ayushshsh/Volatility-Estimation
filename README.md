# Volatility-Estimation

This project focuses on estimating and analyzing the volatility of the S&P 500 Index using ARCH (Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) and GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) models. The analysis involves examining historical returns of the index and assessing how well these models capture the time-varying nature of volatility.

## Project Overview

Volatility prediction is essential for understanding financial market dynamics and managing risk. This project employs both ARCH and GARCH models to estimate volatility and compares their performance. The goal is to evaluate how effectively these models capture the volatility patterns in the S&P 500 Index and provide insights into market risk.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection:** Fetch historical price data for the S&P 500 Index using `yfinance`.
- **Returns Calculation:** Compute daily returns based on adjusted closing prices.
- **Volatility Estimation:**
  - **ARCH Model:** Estimate volatility using the ARCH model.
  - **GARCH Model:** Enhance volatility estimation with the GARCH model to capture more complex dynamics.
- **Model Comparison:** Compare the performance of ARCH and GARCH models in terms of volatility forecasting accuracy.
- **Analysis:** Visualize volatility trends and analyze model outputs.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following Python packages:
- `yfinance` for data retrieval
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- `arch` for ARCH/GARCH modeling
- `matplotlib` for data visualization

## Conclusion

The GARCH model is generally more flexible and capable of capturing complex volatility dynamics compared to the ARCH model. However, both models provide valuable insights into the volatility of the S&P 500 Index.
